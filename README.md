# **Ticket Booking System 🎟️🚆**  

This project is a **Java-based ticket booking system** that demonstrates my foundational knowledge of **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It includes core functionalities such as **user authentication, train search, ticket booking, and cancellation**, all managed through a structured and efficient codebase.  

The project was initially inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/AlphaDecodeX/TicketBookingSystem), but I have made significant improvements and enhancements to refine its functionality and structure.  

## 🔹 Key Concepts Implemented  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction  
- **File Handling** – JSON-based local database for user and ticket storage  
- **Authentication & Security** – Secure password hashing and validation  
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** – Clear separation of concerns (User Service, Booking Service, etc.)  
- **Data Serialization** – Using **Jackson** for JSON parsing and serialization  
- **Exception Handling** – Graceful error handling for robust execution  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- **Spring Boot Integration** for improved backend structure and RESTful API support  
- **Frontend UI** using **React** for a modern user experience  
- **Database Integration** with MySQL/PostgreSQL for scalable data management  

This project showcases my skills in **Java development, software design principles, and real-world application structuring**. 🚆💻
